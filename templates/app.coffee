# app.coffee

# Use `app.coffee` to run your app without `sails lift`.
# To start the server, run: `coffee app.coffee`.

# This is handy in situations where the sails CLI is not relevant or useful.

# For example:
# => `coffee app.coffee`
# => `forever start -c coffee app.coffee`
# => `coffee --nodejs debug app.coffee`
# => `modulus deploy`
# => `heroku scale`


# The same command-line arguments are supported, e.g.:
# `coffee app.coffee --silent --port=80 --prod`
